Chess Royale's Project

An Android application used to develop skills in the Android platform, Kotlin and, at the moment, Jetpack Compose.
The app has modes to play 1vs1 online and offline and solve puzzles fetched from Lichess API. 

At moment is being used to get practice with Jetpack Compose. The first version of the app uses XML to define the elements in the
different Activities. Those XML layout files and respective Activities are being replaced with Compose Activities.

The app uses a set of Android libraries and APIs like Room, WorkManager API or Retrofit. It also makes use of Firebase's Pub/Sub in 
the the 1vs1 online mode.

Plans for the future:
1. Migrate from XML layout files and Activities to Compose Activites
2. Develop an AI to build an 1 vs AI mode
